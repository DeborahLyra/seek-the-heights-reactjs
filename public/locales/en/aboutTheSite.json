    "aboutChurchText": "The Catholic Church is more than just an institution — it is a spiritual, living, and universal family, founded by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit for over two thousand years. Present in every corner of the world, it proclaims the Gospel, celebrates the sacraments, and welcomes all who seek to live a concrete, profound, and transformative faith. In the Church, we find the nourishment of the Word, the strength of the Eucharist, the witness of the saints, and the beauty of a tradition that unites faith and reason, heart and history.",
